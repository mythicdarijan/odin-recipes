    <h1>Omelette Recipe</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and
        butter in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat until the butter
        has melted and is foaming.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the eggs into the pan, tilt the pan ever so slightly from one side
        to another to allow the eggs to swirl and cover the surface of the pan
        completely. Let the mixture cook for about 20 seconds then scrape a line
        through the middle with a spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg.
        Repeat once or twice more until the egg has just set.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like – some
        grated cheese, sliced ham, fresh herbs, sautéed mushrooms or smoked
        salmon all work well. Scatter the filling over the top of the omelette
        and fold gently in half with the spatula. Slide onto a plate to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
